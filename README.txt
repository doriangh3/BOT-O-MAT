Things to note: 
Each Robot Type and Task has an integer value called taskType. This value determines if a robot will get credit for a particular task they were assigned. 
Task with a taskType of 0 will give credit to any robot type who completes it regardless of their taskType, while task with a taskType 1-8 will only give
credit to those robot types that have the same corresponding taskType. I just wanted to make this one point clear. Thank you.
